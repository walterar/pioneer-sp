Hi

Thanks for downloading my facegen mod for Pioneer.

I really appreciate your interest!
It has taken so long to get it to this stage because of my life getting in the way.
I would love to work some more on it as it's nowhere near where I want it to be.

If you like what you see here and want to see more then there's no better way of showing your support than to send me a
small donation (or a large one, I'm not picky) via paypal to: waynenipple@hotmail.com. You can even send me an email if you like.


I have plans to expand this mod over time to be worthy of being in Pioneer and hopefully it will be bundled with it as part
of the game some day in the future.

I really appreciate your time and thankyou for reading this.
